In this task we learned how to work with interfaces, classes and interface expansion.
In this task we realized the function that describes the "polynomial". The polynomial was executed by creating an ArrayList of "Monom" strings. "Monom" is a class with functions that cause it to exist and also to support the polynomial class. In the polynomial class there are functions that depend on functions from the "Monom" class and others that do not. The "Monom" class realized the interface "function", which receives a value of x and returns the equation solution.
We implemented the interfaces in several stages:
1. We have studied how monom and polynomial functions behave and beyond, how the Riemann's integral is calculated by the sum of the rectangles that exist between the polynomial and the x-axis.
2. Since we were required to take a string in the polynomial function, we had to understand the conditions for obtaining a valid string and how to handle it when we received an invalid string.
3. We studied each function, what objects it receives and which returns.
4. We realized each function and checked that it was working as desired.
5. We performed tests on all functions together.
This task contains a large number of new topics for us and therefore made us explore and understand it in depth so that we can submit it at the desired level. 
Apart from the new work with interfaces, we had to investigate in depth how each function works.
This task helped us to understand these issues in depth.
